## Exercise 1 - Possible Data Types
Copy this code into a new project and correct the data types to
complete the variables.

    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
        int main() {
        firstNumber = 1;
        iCanCode = true;
        hopefulGrade = 'a';
        myDecimal = 1.0;
        minimalSentance = "y";
        keyMash = 13213123;
        mysteryDataType = 5.6f; //Use Google to work this out
        
        cin.get(); //keeps console window open in Visual Studio
        return 0;
        }
        
        
## Exercise 2 - Division Fix
This program doesn’t quite work as expected, can you figure
out a solution

    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

        int main() {
        int numberOne = 50;
        int numberTwo = 7;
        cout << numberOne/numberTwo << endl;
        cin.get(); //keeps console window open in Visual Studio
        return 0;
    }
    
## Exercise 3 - Untidy Code
Tidy up the code to make it easier to understand
  
    #include <iostream>
    #include <string>
    using namespace std;
    int main(){

        cout << "This is untidy code.";

        cout << "I'm surprised it works.";

    int number = 6;

        cout << "It has" <<

        number << "lines of code - " ;

        cout << "each more hideous than the last. ";

        cout << "You probably should add some line breaks

        in the text too" << endl;

    cin.get(); //keeps console window open in Visual Studio
    return 0;
    }
    
## Exercise 4 - USB Shopper


• A girl heads to a computer shop to buy
some USB sticks.She loves USB sticks and
wants as many as she can get for AED 50.
They areAED 6 each.

• Write a programme that calculates how
many USB sticks she can buy and how
many fils she will have left.

• You will need some of the following
arithmetic operators (e.g. +, -, /, *, %) to
achieve this.


## Exercise 5 - Declaration and Intialisation

Set up a new project and follow the below
steps:

• Declare a variable with data type integer.
Initialise with a value of 8.

• Declare a variable with data type integer.
Initialise with a value of 10.

• Declare a third variable of data type
integer that sums the answer.

• Print the final variable to console.

## Exercise 1 - Biography
Create a program that prints the following to the console

Part 1: Create a program that prints your name,  hometown and age to the console. The program  has the following constraints:

* Each item should be stored using a variable of
an appropriate data type.
* Each item should be printed on a new line.

Part 2: Modify your program such that the  computer asks the user for their name and  hometown, then stores these in variables (hint:  we’ve used cout for output, perhaps there is  something similar for input? Also for now only  give it your first name). Now use the variables to  print the short biography with the values  entered by the user.


## Exercise 2 - Temperature (Fahrenheit to Celsius)
Part 1: Create a program to convert  temperature in Fahrenheit to Celsius!

Fahrenheit to celsius → (f - 32) * [0.556])

You should make use of variables such that  your program prints to console:

    "X Fahrenheit is Y in Celsius"
    
Where X is the value you specify (as in an  appropriate data type) and Y is the calculated  result

Part 2: Enhance your program by having the  computer ask the user for the temperature in  Fahrenheit


## Exercise 3 - Temperature (Celsius to Fahrenheit)

Part 1: Create a program to convert  temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit


Where X is the value you specify (as in an  appropriate data type) and Y is the calculated  result

Part 2: Enhance your program by having the  computer ask the user for the temperature in  Celsius


## Exercise 4 - Circles

Write a program that calculates (and  displays) the area (A) and circumference (C)  of a circle given its radius (r). The program  should get the radius from the user. Make  your code as clear as possible by using  variables of appropriate data types and  comments.

* A = π r2
* C = 2π r

## Exercise 5 - Rectangle Triangle Square

Write a program that calculates (and  displays) the area of rectangle, triangle and square.

The program  should get the length and width from the user. Make  your code as clear as possible by using  variables of appropriate data types and  comments.

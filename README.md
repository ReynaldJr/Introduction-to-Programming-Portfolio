<p align="center">Hello and welcome to my portfolio for my course in 'Introduction to Programming'</p>
  
<p align="center">This repository contains all of the projects that demonstrate my thorough knowledge of the programming language: C++, ranging from the fundamental concepts of variables to the usage of functions for passing arguments.</p>
  
<p align="center">Each folder in the repository is named after a chapter covered in our course. Files labeled 'Example' are programs taught in our class to follow. Additionally, files labeled 'Exercise' are programs that were assigned to our class to accomplish as a task for that particular chapter.</p>
